Portfolio of work done at Wasabi

# The S3 Console App
## Extensive changes were made to the Application, besides the obvious visual upgrade.
* Every single component using material-ui had to be upgraded, as it was using a deprecated version
* Designed with strict requirements for usability by those who use screen readers, or are otherwise visually impaired
* Webpack v3 to v4 upgrade - necessitated a full configuration rewrite
* Every string within the app has full internationalization support
* Brand new, highly customized Toast notification system, based on notistack
* Brand new, highly configurable Modal system
* Smooth animation transitions throughout
* Skeleton loading for all pain points
* Full mobile support
